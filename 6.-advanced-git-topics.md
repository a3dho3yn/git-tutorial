# 6. Advanced Git Topics

#### **Rebasing (`git rebase`)**

Rebasing is a process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It's a way to integrate changes from one branch into another, but unlike merging, it does so by reapplying the commits.

Usage:

1.  Switch to the branch you want to rebase:

    ```bash

    git checkout feature-branch

    ```
2.  Start the rebase process:

    ```bash

    git rebase master

    ```

This will take the changes made in **`feature-branch`** and reapply them on top of **`master`**. The result is a linear history.

**Note:** Rebasing rewrites history, which can be problematic for shared branches. It's recommended to use rebasing only for branches that haven't been pushed to a remote repository or shared with other collaborators.

#### **Stashing (`git stash`)**

Stashing allows you to temporarily save changes that you don't want to commit immediately. It's useful when you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit your current changes.

Usage:

1.  To stash your changes:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git stash

    ```
2.  To apply your stashed changes:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git stash apply

    ```
3.  To list all stashes:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git stash list

    ```
4.  To drop a stash:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git stash drop stash@{n}

    ```

Where **`n`** is the stash number.

#### **Interactive commits (`git commit --interactive`)**

Actually, the correct command for interactive staging is **`git add --interactive`** (or **`git add -i`**). This mode allows you to interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the working tree.

Usage:

1.  Start the interactive staging:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git add --interactive

    ```
2. Follow the prompts to choose patches of changes to stage.

#### **Cherry-picking (`git cherry-pick`)**

Cherry-picking allows you to apply changes from specific commits without merging an entire branch. It's useful when you want to take just one or two commits from a feature branch and apply them to your main branch.

Usage:

1. Find the commit hash of the commit you want to cherry-pick. You can use **`git log`** to view commit hashes.
2.  Use the cherry-pick command followed by the commit hash:

    ```bash
    bashCopy code
    git cherry-pick commit-hash

    ```

If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them. Once resolved, you can continue the cherry-pick process with:

```bash
bashCopy code
git cherry-pick --continue

```

**Note:** Like rebasing, cherry-picking can rewrite commit history. It's essential to use it judiciously, especially with commits that have been shared with others.
